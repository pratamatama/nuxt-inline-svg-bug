# nuxt-inline-svg-bug-firefox

I can't give the entire project structure as the project are supposed to be private,
so I made a minimalist reproduction, a copy of a navbar from the original project
which loads the SVG component to show the error.

The configuration is made exactly the same as the original one.
Please have a look.

Thanks in advance!
